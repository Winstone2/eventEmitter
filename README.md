# eventEmitter
This code demonstrates the use of the EventEmitter class in Node.js to create a custom event emitter and handle events.

    The code begins by importing the events module and creating a class named MyEmitter that extends the EventEmitter class. This allows instances of MyEmitter to emit and listen to events.

    An instance of MyEmitter named myEmitter is created.

    Two event listeners are attached to the myEmitter instance using the .on() method:
        The first listener is for the event named 'start', and it logs "Starting..." to the console when the event is emitted.
        The second listener is for the event named 'end', and it logs "Ending..." to the console when the event is emitted.

    The .emit() method is used to emit the 'start' and 'end' events on the myEmitter instance.

Thought Process:

    Import the events module to access the EventEmitter class.

    Define a custom class MyEmitter that extends EventEmitter. This allows instances of MyEmitter to inherit the event handling capabilities.

    Create an instance of MyEmitter named myEmitter.

    Attach event listeners to myEmitter using the .on() method. When an event with the specified name is emitted, the attached callback function will be executed.

    Emit the 'start' event using myEmitter.emit('start'). Since there is a corresponding listener for this event, the callback function will log "Starting..." to the console.

    Emit the 'end' event using myEmitter.emit('end'). The corresponding listener will execute, logging "Ending..." to the console.

The EventEmitter class provides a way to implement the Observer pattern in Node.js, allowing different parts of your application to communicate and respond to events. It's a powerful mechanism for decoupling components and handling asynchronous interactions.
