# eventEmitter
In Node.js, an EventEmitter is a built-in class that allows you to handle and manage events in a more structured way. 
It's particularly useful for building applications that involve asynchronous operations or for handling interactions between different parts of your code.
An EventEmitter object in Node.js provides methods for registering event listeners and emitting events. An event is essentially a signal that indicates that something of interest has happened. EventEmitters allow you to create custom events and associate them with specific actions or functions.
Explanation of the Provided Code:
Let's break down the code step by step:

    Import the events module and create a class MyEmitter that extends EventEmitter.
    Instantiate an object myEmitter from the MyEmitter class.
    Use the on method to attach an event listener to the event event. When the event is emitted, the provided callback function will be executed.
    Emit the event event using the emit method.
    
    Thought Process:

    Import the events module.
    Create a class FileProcessor that extends EventEmitter. This class represents a file processing system.
    Inside FileProcessor, define a method processFile that simulates processing a file. After processing, emit a processed event and pass the filePath as data.
    Instantiate a fileProcessor object from the FileProcessor class.
    Attach an event listener using on to listen for the processed event and log a message when the event is emitted.
    Call the processFile method on the fileProcessor object, simulating the initiation of file processing.

    When you run this code, you'll see messages indicating the start and finish of the file processing, all managed through the EventEmitter mechanism.
